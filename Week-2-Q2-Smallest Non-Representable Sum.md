#  Problem Title: Smallest Non-Representable Sum
###  You are designing a secure digital wallet system. Each user has a set of coin denominations (represented as a sorted array of positive integers). For internal validation, you must
###  determine the smallest amount of money that cannot be formed using any subset of the given denominations.
###  This functionality is crucial for detecting missing denominations and optimizing wallet design. The challenge? You need to solve this efficiently â€“ in linear time relative to the size
###  of the input array.
