#  Problem Statement ->
Given an array that was initially sorted in ascending order but then rotated at an unknown
pivot, write an efficient algorithm to find the minimum element in the array.
â€¢ The array contains no duplicate elements.
â€¢ Your solution must run in O(log N) time.

## Approach 1 : (We can say short trick ) 
Just Sort the array and return the first element thats our answer.
Let analyize the Arrays.sort() :- It uses dual pivote QuickSort -> 
Picks two pivots instead of one.
Splits array into three parts:
1. Less than first pivot
2. Between pivots
3. Greater than second pivot
Recursively sorts each part.
-> Time compl. : in **Best case & Avg case** -> O(n *log n)
                 in **Worest case** -> O(N^2)
### Why not this ->  In Question  given O(logn) and this approach does not acheive  it. Lets eg : Suppose n = 1000 then log*n = 10 approx. and other hand
###  n *log n = 10,000 approx so here is a huge differnce b/w them.
### code->
```java
public static int rotate(int arr[]){
  Arrays.sort(arr);
  return arr[0];
}
```
## Approach 2 : For Loop + Math.min (Another simple approach)
Iterate a for loop over array and check every element with min.
### Time Compl. for this approach -> In best, avg and worst case this runs in O(N) comple.
```java
public static int rotate(int[] nums) {
        int min = nums[0];  
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            min = Math.min(min, nums[i]);
        }
        return min;
    }
```
### Why not this -> suppose in the middle of iteration we found min(as we dont know it minimun or not) we have to iterate till end element. Thats why it holds O(N) Time-comple.
## Approach 3 : By Using Recursion 
In this we find mid point and check recusrively.
```java
public int rotate(int[] nums, int low, int high) {
    if (low == high) return nums[low];

    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

    if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) {
        return rotate(nums, mid + 1, high);
    } else {
        return rotate(nums, low, mid);
    }
}

```
