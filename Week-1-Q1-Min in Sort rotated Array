#  Problem Statement ->
Given an array that was initially sorted in ascending order but then rotated at an unknown
pivot, write an efficient algorithm to find the minimum element in the array.
• The array contains no duplicate elements.
• Your solution must run in O(log N) time.

### Approach 1 : (We can say short trick ) 
Just Sort the array and return the first element thats our answer.
Let analyize the Arrays.sort() :- It uses dual pivote QuickSort -> 
```
// Picks two pivots instead of one.
// Splits array into three parts:
// 1. Less than first pivot
// 2. Between pivots
// 3. Greater than second pivot
// Recursively sorts each part.
```
